/*
 * 2626 | Array Reduce Transformation
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * ----------------
 *
 * Description:
 * Given an integer array "nums", a reducer function "fn", and an initial value
 * "init", return the final result obtained by executing the "fn" function on
 * each element of the array, sequentially, passing in the return value from the
 * calculation on the preceding element.
 *
 * This result is achieved through the following operations: "val = fn(init,
 * nums[0]), val = fn(val, nums[1]), val = fn(val, nums[2]), ..." until every
 * element in the array has been processed. The ultimate value of "val" is then
 * returned.
 *
 * If the length of the array is 0, the function should return "init".
 *
 * Please solve it without using the built-in "Array.reduce" method.

	// In case the array is empty, return init
	if (nums.length < 1) return init;

	// Initiate the accumulator with the init value
	let acc = init;
	nums.forEach((value) => {
		acc = fn(acc, value);
